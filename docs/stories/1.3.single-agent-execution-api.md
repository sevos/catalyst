# Story 1.3: Single Agent Execution API

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED & MERGED** - [PR #23](https://github.com/sevos/catalyst/pull/23)

## Story
**As a** Rails Developer,
**I want** to implement single agent execution capability that processes agent configuration, input parameters, and user messages to generate system prompts and execute single LLM requests via RubyLLM integration,
**so that** I can execute AI agents with their configured prompts and get results from LLMs synchronously without background processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Agent#execute method accepts user_message as first argument and returns plain text LLM response synchronously
2. Agent#execute method creates an execution record with pending status before processing
3. Execution status is updated to running when processing begins, then to completed/failed based on outcome
4. System prompt is constructed by rendering ERB template from app/ai/prompts/ using agent attributes
5. ERB template resolution follows Rails-like naming convention based on agent class name
6. ERB template inheritance chain is supported for custom agents that inherit from ApplicationAgent
7. RubyLLM integration sends system prompt and user message to configured LLM model
8. Execution record is updated with LLM response, completion status, and interaction tracking before method returns
9. All agent attributes from both delegated type and underlying Catalyst::Agent are captured in execution's input_params field
10. Failed executions update to failed status with error_message, preserve partial results, but execute method raises exception
11. Execute method implementation is organized into logical private methods or concerns for readability

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- RubyLLM integration completed in Story 1.2.1 with comprehensive configuration
- Agent generation system completed in Story 1.2 with prompt template support in app/ai/prompts/
- Core models established in Story 1.1 with delegated types architecture
- Execution model has chat-like fields: interaction_count, last_interaction_at, input_params
- Prompt templates use ERB with agent attributes accessible

**Data Models:**
- **Catalyst::Agent**: Base model with delegated types, has name, model, model_params, max_iterations [Source: architecture/data-model.md#Primary Models]
- **Catalyst::Execution**: Tracks executions with status enum (pending, running, completed, failed), prompt, result, error_message, started_at, completed_at, interaction_count, last_interaction_at, input_params [Source: architecture/data-model.md#Execution Tracking]
- **ApplicationAgent**: Simple agent type with role, goal, backstory attributes as database columns [Source: architecture/data-model.md#ApplicationAgent]
- **Catalyst::Agentable**: Module providing delegated type behavior with execute method [Source: architecture/data-model.md#Catalyst::Agentable Module]

**API Specifications:**
- **Agent#execute method**: Should accept user_message as first argument, execute synchronously, return plain text LLM response
- **Input parameters**: Capture all agent attributes from both delegated type (e.g., ApplicationAgent) and underlying Catalyst::Agent for comprehensive auditing
- **Execution tracking**: Create execution record with pending status, update to running during processing, then to completed/failed
- **Error handling**: Failed executions update to failed status with error_message, preserve partial results, but execute method raises exception
- **Code organization**: Implement using logical private methods or concerns to maintain readability

**Component Specifications:**
- **Prompt templates**: ERB templates in app/ai/prompts/ directory receiving @agent instance for attribute access [Source: lib/generators/catalyst/agent/templates/agent_prompt.md.erb]
- **Template resolution**: Rails-like naming convention based on agent class name with inheritance chain support
  - ApplicationAgent → app/ai/prompts/application_agent.md.erb
  - Marketing::CampaignAgent → app/ai/prompts/marketing/campaign_agent.md.erb (with ApplicationAgent fallback)
- **Agent attributes**: Database columns like role, goal, backstory accessible as @agent.role, @agent.goal, @agent.backstory in ERB templates
- **RubyLLM integration**: Use configured default model (gpt-4.1-nano) with parameter support, execute synchronously, return plain text response [Source: architecture/execution-flow.md#LLM Integration]
- **Execution tracking**: Create and update execution record synchronously with status transitions (pending → running → completed/failed)
- **Input parameters**: Merge all attributes from both delegated type and underlying Catalyst::Agent for comprehensive auditing
- **Error handling**: Handle RubyLLM exceptions, update execution to failed status with error_message, preserve partial results, then raise exception
- **Code organization**: Use logical private methods or concerns to keep execute method readable and maintainable

**File Locations:**
- Agent model: `/app/models/catalyst/agent.rb`
- Execution model: `/app/models/catalyst/execution.rb`
- Prompt templates: `/app/ai/prompts/*.md.erb` (from Story 1.2)
- Test files: `/test/models/catalyst/`, `/test/jobs/catalyst/`

**Technical Constraints:**
