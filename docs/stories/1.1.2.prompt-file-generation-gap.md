# Story 1.1.2: Prompt File Generation for ApplicationAgent - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **developer using Catalyst framework**,  
I want **`rails g catalyst:install` to create prompt files like `rails g catalyst:agent` does**,  
So that **I have consistent prompt file generation across all Catalyst generators**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Rails generator system and existing `catalyst:agent` generator  
- Technology: Ruby on Rails generators
- Follows pattern: Existing prompt file creation pattern from `catalyst:agent`
- Touch points: Install generator workflow, prompt file template system

## Background

This story addresses a consistency gap identified in Epic 1. The `rails g catalyst:agent` generator creates prompt files, but `rails g catalyst:install` does not, creating an inconsistent developer experience. This should have been implemented as part of Story 1.1.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. `rails g catalyst:install` generates prompt files with same structure as `catalyst:agent`
2. Prompt file generation follows existing naming and location conventions
3. Generated prompt files are properly configured for ApplicationAgent context

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing `catalyst:agent` generator functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing prompt file generation pattern
6. Integration with Rails generator system maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Change is covered by appropriate generator tests
8. Generator documentation is updated to reflect prompt file creation
9. No regression in existing install generator functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing install generator to include prompt file creation logic from agent generator
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Copy/adapt prompt file generation from `catalyst:agent` generator
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain backward compatibility with existing install generator usage

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Install generator creates prompt files matching agent generator pattern
- [ ] Existing install generator functionality verified unchanged  
- [ ] Existing agent generator functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing generator patterns and standards
- [ ] Generator tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Generator documentation updated

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Breaking existing install generator functionality
**Mitigation:** Thorough testing of existing install workflow before/after changes
**Rollback:** Simple git revert of generator changes

## Compatibility Verification

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing install generator API
- [ ] File generation changes are additive only  
- [ ] Generated files follow existing Catalyst patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Story Classification

- **Type:** Bug/Gap Fix
- **Epic:** Epic 1
- **Related Story:** Story 1.1 (where this should have been implemented)
- **Priority:** High (consistency gap in delivered functionality)
- **Effort:** Small (single development session, ~2-4 hours)

## Testing

### Test Framework & Patterns
- **Framework:** Rails/MiniTest (following existing generator test patterns)
- **Test Location:** Extend existing `test/generators/catalyst/install_generator_test.rb`
- **Base Class:** `Rails::Generators::TestCase`

### Required Test Scenarios
1. **Prompt File Generation**
   ```ruby
   test "generates prompt files for ApplicationAgent" do
     run_generator
     assert_file "app/ai/prompts/application_agent_prompt.md" do |content|
       assert_match(/# ApplicationAgent Prompt/, content)
       # Validate prompt structure matches agent generator pattern
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   ```ruby
   test "existing install functionality unchanged" do
     run_generator
     # Test all existing assertions still pass
     assert_migration "db/migrate/create_catalyst_agents.rb"
     assert_file "config/initializers/catalyst.rb"
     assert_file "app/models/application_agent.rb"
   end
   ```

3. **Directory Structure**
   ```ruby
   test "creates prompt directory structure" do
     run_generator
     assert_directory "app/ai/prompts"
   end
   ```

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific install generator tests
bundle exec ruby -Itest test/generators/catalyst/install_generator_test.rb

# Run all generator tests
bundle exec rails test test/generators/
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Research Existing Prompt File Generation Pattern
- [ ] Examine current `catalyst:agent` generator for prompt file creation logic
- [ ] Identify prompt file templates and naming conventions  
- [ ] Document the pattern to replicate in install generator

### Task 2: Implement Prompt File Generation in Install Generator
- [ ] Add prompt file generation logic to install generator
- [ ] Use ApplicationAgent context for generated prompt files
- [ ] Ensure proper directory structure creation (`app/ai/prompts/`)
- [ ] Follow existing file naming conventions

### Task 3: Update Generator Tests
- [ ] Add test for prompt file generation in install generator test
- [ ] Add test for prompt directory creation
- [ ] Verify all existing install generator tests still pass
- [ ] Add regression tests for backward compatibility

### Task 4: Validate Implementation
- [ ] Run generator tests: `bundle exec ruby -Itest test/generators/catalyst/install_generator_test.rb`
- [ ] Test install generator manually in dummy app
- [ ] Verify prompt files are created correctly
- [ ] Confirm no existing functionality broken
