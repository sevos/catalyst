# Story 4.3: Multi-Tenancy Integration Support

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Rails Developer using a gem like `acts_as_tenant`,
**I want** to easily ensure that all agent executions and logs are correctly scoped to the current tenant by following clear documentation,
**so that** I can safely use the framework in my SaaS application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `Execution` and `ExecutionStep` models are updated with a field (e.g., `tenant_id`) to enable tenant scoping.
2. The framework's `ActiveJob` is designed to correctly receive and re-establish the tenant scope (e.g., from the secure context) within the background job.
3. The dashboard controllers operate within the host application's existing tenancy scope.
4. Comprehensive documentation is created with a guide for integrating with `acts_as_tenant`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add tenant scoping to models (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add tenant_id field to Execution model
  - [ ] Add tenant_id field to ExecutionStep model
  - [ ] Create migration for tenant_id fields
  - [ ] Add tenant associations and validations
- [ ] Update ActiveJob for tenant scope (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Modify ExecutionJob to accept tenant context
  - [ ] Re-establish tenant scope in background job
  - [ ] Handle tenant scope from secure context
- [ ] Scope dashboard controllers (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Apply tenant scoping to ExecutionsController
  - [ ] Ensure only tenant-scoped executions are visible
  - [ ] Maintain tenant context across dashboard views
- [ ] Create integration documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Document acts_as_tenant integration steps
  - [ ] Provide configuration examples
  - [ ] Include tenant context setup guide
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree info:**
- Model updates in `/app/models/catalyst/execution.rb` and `/app/models/catalyst/execution_step.rb`
- Job updates in `/app/jobs/catalyst/execution_job.rb`
- Controller updates in `/app/controllers/catalyst/executions_controller.rb`
- Documentation at `/docs/integration/multi-tenancy.md`

**Important notes:**
- This depends on Story 4.2 (Implement Secure Context Passing)
- Critical for SaaS applications with multi-tenancy
- Tenant isolation prevents data leakage between tenants
- Documentation ensures proper integration by developers

### Testing
- Test file location: `/test/models/catalyst/` for model tests, `/test/controllers/catalyst/` for controller tests
- Test standards: Test tenant scoping, isolation, context handling
- Testing frameworks: Use Rails minitest with multi-tenancy testing patterns
- Specific requirements: Test tenant isolation, scope enforcement, job context
