# Story 1.2: Agent Generation & Configuration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Rails Developer,
**I want** to use a generator to create either simple or advanced Agent classes with their prompt templates,
**so that** I can quickly start defining AI agents ranging from basic to highly customized types.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Running `rails g catalyst:agent MyAgent` creates a simple agent class at `app/ai/my_agent.rb` inheriting from `ApplicationAgent`.
2. The generator creates a corresponding prompt template at `app/ai/prompts/my_agent.md.erb`.
3. Simple agents inherit from `ApplicationAgent` and use its `role`, `goal`, and `backstory` attributes.
4. Running `rails g catalyst:agent MarketingAgent --custom-attributes campaign_type:string product_id:integer` creates a custom delegated type with migration.
5. Custom agents include `Catalyst::Agentable` and are automatically registered in `config/initializers/catalyst.rb`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create simple agent generation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Generate simple agent class template inheriting from ApplicationAgent
  - [x] Place generated file in app/ai/ directory
  - [x] Create prompt template ERB file in app/ai/prompts/
  - [x] Include role, goal, backstory variables in template
- [x] Create custom agent generation (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Parse --custom-attributes argument with type notation
  - [x] Generate custom agent model with include Catalyst::Agentable
  - [x] Create migration with custom attributes and appropriate column types
  - [x] Generate prompt template for custom agent
  - [x] Update config/initializers/catalyst.rb to register new delegated type
- [x] Create unified catalyst:agent generator
  - [x] Implement generator logic with --custom-attributes detection
  - [x] Add validation for attribute format (name:type)
  - [x] Support standard Rails column types (string, integer, text, json, etc.)
  - [x] Follow Rails generator naming conventions

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree info:**
- Base Agent class should be at `/app/models/catalyst/agent.rb`
- Generator should be at `/lib/generators/catalyst/agent/agent_generator.rb`
- Generator templates should be in `/lib/generators/catalyst/agent/templates/`
- Host application agents will be at `app/ai/`
- Custom agent migrations will be generated in `db/migrate/`
- Catalyst initializer at `config/initializers/catalyst.rb`

**Important notes:**
- This builds on Story 1.1 (Core Models & Installation)
- Simple agents inherit from ApplicationAgent (already exists from Story 1.1)
- Custom agents use delegated types pattern with Catalyst::Agentable module
- Generator should follow Rails naming conventions
- Prompt templates should support ERB for dynamic content
- Custom attributes support standard Rails column types
- Automatic registration in initializer prevents manual configuration

### Testing
- Test file location: `/test/generators/catalyst/agent/` for generator tests
- Test standards: Test both simple and custom agent generation
- Testing frameworks: Use Rails generator testing utilities
- Specific requirements: 
  - Test simple agent creation (inheritance from ApplicationAgent)
  - Test custom agent creation with --custom-attributes
  - Test migration generation with correct column types
  - Test initializer registration for custom agents
  - Test prompt template generation for both variants
  - Test file creation, content, and naming conventions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-09
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation** with solid Rails generator patterns, comprehensive testing, and good architectural decisions. The unified generator approach is clean and maintainable. The conditional template logic for simple vs custom agents is well-designed and user-friendly.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `/lib/generators/catalyst/agent/agent_generator.rb`
  - **Change**: Fixed initializer update logic to match actual `Catalyst.configure` format instead of incorrect `Rails.application.configure`
  - **Why**: The original implementation was targeting the wrong initializer pattern, which would have caused runtime failures
  - **How**: Updated regex and string manipulation to work with the actual `Catalyst.configure do |config|` block

- **File**: `/lib/generators/catalyst/agent/agent_generator.rb`
  - **Change**: Added robust input validation for attribute names and column types with helpful error messages
  - **Why**: Prevents generator failures at runtime and provides clear feedback for invalid inputs
  - **How**: Added `normalize_column_type` method with type aliases and validation, plus regex validation for attribute names

- **File**: `/lib/generators/catalyst/agent/templates/custom_agent.rb`
  - **Change**: Improved template structure with better conditional logic and cleaner comments
  - **Why**: Makes generated code more readable and handles edge cases better
  - **How**: Added conditional blocks for attributes and improved comment structure

- **File**: `/test/generators/catalyst/agent/agent_generator_test.rb`
  - **Change**: Updated test for initializer logic and added comprehensive validation tests
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to initializer format mismatch and validation logic needed coverage
  - **How**: Added 4 new test cases covering validation scenarios and fixed initializer test mock

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Rails generator conventions and project patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files in correct locations as specified in Dev Notes
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and error conditions
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist
[All items handled during review]

- [x] Fixed initializer update logic to match actual Catalyst configuration format
- [x] Added robust input validation for attribute names and column types
- [x] Enhanced custom agent template with better conditional logic
- [x] Added comprehensive test coverage for validation scenarios
- [x] Improved error messages and user feedback for invalid inputs
- [x] Ensured all tests pass and no regressions introduced

### Security Review
✓ **No security concerns identified**
- Input validation prevents injection attacks through attribute names
- File path handling uses Rails generators' secure path resolution
- No sensitive data exposure in generated files

### Performance Considerations
✓ **No performance issues identified**
- Memoization used appropriately for parsed attributes
- File operations are minimal and efficient
- Generator runs quickly for both simple and complex scenarios

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary**: Outstanding implementation that exceeded requirements. The developer delivered a robust, well-tested generator with excellent Rails conventions. My refactoring addressed a critical initializer bug and added enterprise-grade validation. The code is production-ready with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.
