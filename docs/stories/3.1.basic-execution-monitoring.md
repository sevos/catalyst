# Story 3.1: Basic Execution Monitoring

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Rails Developer,
**I want** a dashboard to list all my agent executions and be able to click on one to see its initial input and final output,
**so that** I can monitor the high-level activity and results of my agents.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `Execution` ActiveRecord model stores the initial input/prompt and the final output/result.
2. The framework's Engine provides routes for both an index page (`/catalyst`) and a show page (`/catalyst/executions/:id`).
3. The index page lists all `Execution` records and links to their respective show pages.
4. The simple show page displays the `Execution`'s initial input and its final output.
5. Both pages are styled with Tailwind CSS and receive real-time status updates via Hotwire.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Mount routes in Engine configuration
  - [ ] Add route helpers
- [ ] Create executions index page (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create ExecutionsController with index action
  - [ ] Create index view template

- [ ] Add styling and real-time updates (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Include Tailwind CSS in Engine views
  - [ ] Add Hotwire for real-time updates
  - [ ] Style both index and show pages

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree info:**
- Engine routes in `/config/routes.rb`
- ExecutionsController at `/app/controllers/catalyst/executions_controller.rb`
- Views at `/app/views/catalyst/executions/`
- Execution model at `/app/models/catalyst/execution.rb`

**Important notes:**
- This depends on Epic 2 completion (all 3 stories)
- Provides crucial visibility into agent operations
- Real-time updates enable monitoring of running agents
- Tailwind CSS provides consistent styling

### Testing
- Test file location: `/test/controllers/catalyst/` for controller tests
- Test standards: Test controller actions, view rendering, real-time updates
- Testing frameworks: Use Rails controller testing
- Specific requirements: Test index and show pages, real-time functionality
