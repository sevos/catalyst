# Story 4.1: Research Secure Context & MCP Compatibility

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Framework Developer,
**I want** to research best practices for secure context injection and how they align with the Model Context Protocol (MCP),
**so that** our design is both secure and future-proof.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The current MCP specification is analyzed for relevant standards.
2. At least two patterns for a tool to declare its context dependencies are evaluated.
3. A short architectural decision record (ADR) is produced recommending a specific, secure, and forward-compatible pattern.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze MCP specification (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Research current MCP specification
  - [ ] Identify relevant security standards
  - [ ] Document MCP context handling patterns
- [ ] Evaluate context dependency patterns (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Pattern 1: Declarative context dependencies
  - [ ] Pattern 2: Runtime context injection
  - [ ] Compare security implications of each pattern
  - [ ] Assess forward compatibility with MCP
- [ ] Create architectural decision record (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Document pattern evaluation results
  - [ ] Recommend specific secure pattern
  - [ ] Include implementation considerations
  - [ ] Add migration path for future MCP compatibility

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree info:**
- ADR should be placed in `/docs/architecture/` directory
- Research should reference current MCP documentation
- Security patterns should align with Rails security best practices

**Important notes:**
- This depends on Epic 3 completion (both stories)
- Research story that informs implementation decisions
- Critical for production security and future compatibility
- ADR will guide Stories 4.2 and 4.3 implementations

### Testing
- Test file location: This is a research story with no code testing
- Test standards: N/A for research story
- Testing frameworks: N/A for research story
- Specific requirements: Deliverable is ADR document, not code
