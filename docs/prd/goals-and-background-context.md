# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Establish this framework as the definitive open-source AI solution within the Rails community.  
* Foster an active, engaged, and collaborative community of users and contributors.  
* Generate inbound opportunities for specialized AI and Rails consulting work.

## Background Context

The Catalyst Framework addresses a critical gap in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem. Currently, developers lack a native, production-grade framework for orchestrating AI agents, as the most popular solutions are Python-exclusive. This forces developers to either leave the Rails ecosystem or build complex, brittle integrations. Catalyst aims to solve this by providing a truly open-source, Rails-idiomatic solution with built-in observability, multi-tenancy, and asynchronous processing, making advanced AI development accessible and practical within Rails.
