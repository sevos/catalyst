# Epic 4: The "Secure & Production-Ready Agent"

## Epic Goal
Harden the framework for production use by implementing secure context mechanisms, multi-tenancy support, and production-ready patterns that enable safe deployment in enterprise environments.

## Epic Description

**Problem Statement:**
The framework from Epics 1-3 provides core functionality but lacks the security and production-readiness features needed for enterprise deployment. Sensitive data could be exposed to LLMs, and multi-tenant applications need proper isolation.

**Solution Overview:**
Research and implement secure context patterns aligned with emerging standards like MCP, add multi-tenancy support, and provide comprehensive integration guidance for production deployment.

**Value Proposition:**
- Enables safe production deployment with sensitive data protection
- Provides multi-tenancy support for SaaS applications
- Aligns with emerging industry standards (MCP)
- Reduces security risks and compliance concerns

## Stories

### 4.1: Research Secure Context & MCP Compatibility
Analyze the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification and evaluate secure context patterns to produce an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for production-ready implementation.

### 4.2: Implement Secure Context Passing
Build secure context mechanisms that allow tools to declare context dependencies and receive sensitive data without exposing it to LLMs, following the ADR recommendations.

### 4.3: Multi-Tenancy Integration Support
Add tenant scoping to all models and jobs, ensure dashboard controllers respect tenant boundaries, and provide comprehensive integration documentation for multi-tenant applications.

## Dependencies
- Epic 3 completion (all stories)
- MCP specification research
- Multi-tenancy patterns understanding
- Security best practices knowledge
- Production deployment requirements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Secure context system prevents LLM exposure to sensitive data

- [ ] Production deployment guide is complete

## Timeline
**Target: Sprint 6-7**
- Story 4.1: Research and ADR (Sprint 6)
- Stories 4.2-4.3: Implementation and integration (Sprint 7)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in context handling
  - **Mitigation:** Thorough security review and testing
- **Risk:** Multi-tenancy complexity affects performance
  - **Mitigation:** Efficient scoping and caching strategies
- **Risk:** MCP alignment limits implementation flexibility
  - **Mitigation:** Design for current needs with future compatibility
- **Risk:** Integration complexity for existing applications
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Notes
This epic focuses on production-readiness and security, making the framework suitable for enterprise deployment. The research component ensures alignment with emerging industry standards while maintaining practical implementation goals.
