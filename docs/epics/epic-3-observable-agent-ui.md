# Epic 3: The "Observable Agent" (Proof-of-Concept UI)

## Epic Goal
Provide early visibility into agent operations by building backend logging infrastructure and a proof-of-concept dashboard to display execution traces, enabling developers to monitor and debug agent behavior.

## Epic Description

**Problem Statement:**
Agents from Epics 1 and 2 operate as "black boxes" - developers can't see what the agent is thinking, what tools it's calling, or how it arrives at its results. This makes debugging and monitoring nearly impossible.

**Solution Overview:**
Create a comprehensive logging system that captures detailed execution traces and build a web-based dashboard for viewing agent activity in real-time.

**Value Proposition:**
- Provides visibility into agent reasoning and decision-making
- Enables effective debugging of agent behavior
- Supports monitoring of agent performance and reliability
- Creates foundation for production observability

## Stories

### 3.1: Basic Execution Monitoring
Build a dashboard with index and show pages that display agent execution summaries, including initial inputs and final outputs, with real-time updates via Hotwire.

### 3.2: Detailed Execution Trace
Create an ExecutionStep model to log detailed trace events (thoughts, tool calls, results) and enhance the dashboard to display step-by-step execution traces with real-time streaming.

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 completion (all stories)
- Rails Engine routing and controllers
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Hotwire for real-time updates
- ActiveRecord for execution logging

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard accessible at `/catalyst` route
- [ ] Index page lists all agent executions
- [ ] Show page displays execution details
- [ ] Real-time updates show execution progress
- [ ] Detailed step-by-step traces available
- [ ] UI is responsive and well-styled
- [ ] Performance acceptable with large execution logs

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 2 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Dashboard provides comprehensive execution visibility
- [ ] Real-time updates work reliably
- [ ] UI is intuitive and easy to navigate
- [ ] Step-by-step traces aid in debugging
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for production use
- [ ] Documentation covers dashboard usage

## Timeline
**Target: Sprint 5**
- Story 3.1: Basic dashboard (Sprint 5 first half)
- Story 3.2: Detailed traces (Sprint 5 second half)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Performance impact of detailed logging
  - **Mitigation:** Implement efficient logging and optional detail levels
- **Risk:** Real-time updates reliability
  - **Mitigation:** Use proven Hotwire patterns and fallback mechanisms
- **Risk:** Dashboard security and access control
  - **Mitigation:** Implement basic authentication and scope controls
- **Risk:** Storage requirements for execution logs
  - **Mitigation:** Implement log rotation and cleanup policies

## Notes
This epic is labeled "Proof-of-Concept UI" because it establishes the foundation for observability without requiring full production-ready features. The focus is on core functionality that enables developer productivity.
